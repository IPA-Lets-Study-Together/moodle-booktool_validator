Image and table validation subplugin for Moodle Book

Provides options for validation of images and tables in a way that screen reader software can interpret it.

To install, place all files in /mod/book/tool/validation directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. Validation is then available through Book navigation toolbar. Validation is achieved through search for alt attribute in image tags and summary attribute in table tag.

Current languages are English and Croatian.  If you're
